## Lab 2 (Header)

+ Create a markdown on your GitHub repo that includes various components, such as headers, hyperlinks, images, unordered lists, ordered lists, inline code, code blocks, and YouTube videos. You might find this [Markdown Cheatsheet useful](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). For example:
[_https://github.com/giswqs/leafmap/blob/master/README.md_](https://github.com/opengeos/leafmap/blob/master/README.md) 
- Create a Jupyter notebook on your GitHub repo that contains text, code, and an ‘Open in Colab’ badge. Clicking on the badge should open your notebook in Google Colab. For example:
**https://github.com/giswqs/leafmap/blob/master/examples/notebooks/02_using_basemaps.ipynb**

### Code and Syntax Highlighting
Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's and Markdown Here -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the highlight.js demo page.
 
 ```python
 x = 1
 y = 2
 z = x + y
 print z 
 ```

```
Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
